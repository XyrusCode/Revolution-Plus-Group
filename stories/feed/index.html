<h5>As founder and mother of modern nursing, Florence Nightingale revolutionised healthcare and left an indelible mark on the profession.</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Nurses following in her footsteps are strong-willed individuals, fiercely tenacious and compassionate, just like her.</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>The annual tradition of recognising nurses for their selfless contributions on 12 May was established as early as 1974. This year, we at Sunway shine the limelight on an underrated minority – male nurses.</h5>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this pandemic-stricken world, health professionals have played a monumental role throughout the past year. One such kingpin is nurses, forming the foundation of primary care, symptom management as well as mental support to ailing patients worldwide in hospitals and, now, vaccination centres.</p>
<p>International Nurses Day commemorates the pioneer of modern nursing, Florence Nightingale. The British nurse was given the moniker “The Lady with the Lamp” as a nod to the familiar sight of her making rounds down hallways accompanied by just an oil lamp in the deep of night. Her notable contributions to nursing include setting hygiene standards and personalised patient care, both of which effectively and drastically improved the quality of care in the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
<p>On this important day, we would like to pay homage to nurses everywhere – their nature epitomising empathy and compassion, their duty being the backbone and driving force of the healthcare industry.</p>
<p>Themed Nurses: A Voice to Lead – A vision for future healthcare for this year, the International Council of Nurses (ICN) aims to explore the transformation of the profession on to the next stage of healthcare.</p>
<h2>A Familiar Face</h2>

<p>Long-time followers of Sunway Stories may remember wound care nurse Muhamad Alfateh Yusoff, who stepped forward to <a href="https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/defying-stereotypes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defy gender stereotypes</a> back in 2018, tenderly quoting “universal as love itself” to describe his unconventional profession. Three years later today, Alfateh stands by his mantra, stating matter-of-factly that “being a nurse in itself is satisfying regardless of gender. It is how we treat others that matters.”</p>
<p>However, his journey was not always a bed of roses. He clearly recalls the cold reactions of his family members when he first declared his chosen career path. Regardless, they grew to understand the merit of his profession and eventually supported his decision.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“The circle today is vastly different from when I first started. I am glad that the general public is more receptive of us and acknowledges male nurses to be on par with our female counterparts,” he revealed.</em></p></blockquote>
<div id="attachment_22742" style="width: 820px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-22742" class="size-full wp-image-22742" src="https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SunMed-nurses.jpeg" alt="Heroes in Caribbean Blue" width="810" height="1080" srcset="https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SunMed-nurses-157x209.jpeg 157w, https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SunMed-nurses-200x267.jpeg 200w, https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SunMed-nurses-400x533.jpeg 400w, https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SunMed-nurses-471x628.jpeg 471w, https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SunMed-nurses-600x800.jpeg 600w, https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SunMed-nurses-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SunMed-nurses-800x1067.jpeg 800w, https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SunMed-nurses.jpeg 810w" sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px" /><p id="caption-attachment-22742" class="wp-caption-text">At Sunway Medical Centre, nurses smile with their eyes.</p></div>
<p>Alfateh enjoys the stimulating nature of his job, requiring him to be constantly prepared to face challenges in a fast-paced environment. When asked if there were any memorable incidents that he had wanted to share with the readers, he answered,</p>
<blockquote><p>“There are ups and downs in any career path. Each time where I’ve had the privilege to alleviate one’s pain or contribute to one’s wellbeing is momentous to me,” replied Alfateh, calmly.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alfateh expressed his gratitude to be a part of the nurturing environment at Sunway Medical Centre where the nurses are empowered, more so on special occasions like International Nurses Day. Alfateh is considering to pursue specialisation in either stoma care or orthopaedic to hone his skills and better serve the community.</p>
<h2>Nightingale Reincarnate</h2>

He joined Sunway Medical Centre right after graduating in 2015.</p></div>
<p>27-year-old staff nurse Muhamad Hasri Shafee echoes Alfateh’s sentiments on nursing. Similar to Nightingale, Hasri, the youngest of three children pursued the art of healing against his family’s wishes. Unfazed by the stigma, Hasri announces proudly that he is a registered staff nurse and healthcare practitioner, ever eager to impart his knowledge and expertise to friends and relatives when prompted.</p>
<p>Since joining Sunway Medical Centre, he continues to be pleasantly surprised by the positive team dynamics at work, especially when nurses come together to brainstorm solutions for unprecedented circumstances.</p>

<blockquote><p>“At Sunway Medical Centre, nurses are valued here! I feel a natural sense of camaraderie amongst us. As a result, we are constantly encouraging and supporting each other at work. The ambience is especially heart-warming during days which calls for a celebration like International Nurses Day because it essentially feels like one big family reunion,” Hasri informed, spiritedly.</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Mother Figure of Sunway Medical Centre</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22738" src="https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hwang-Ming-Lan.jpg" alt="Heroes in Caribbean Blue" width="1200" height="1800" srcset="https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hwang-Ming-Lan-139x209.jpg 139w, https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hwang-Ming-Lan-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hwang-Ming-Lan-400x600.jpg 400w, https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hwang-Ming-Lan-419x628.jpg 419w, https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hwang-Ming-Lan-600x900.jpg 600w, https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hwang-Ming-Lan-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hwang-Ming-Lan-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hwang-Ming-Lan-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hwang-Ming-Lan.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>According to Sunway Medical Centre’s Director of Nursing, Hwang Ming Lan, male nurses comprise just 10 percent of the nursing task force here. As a founding member of the hospital, and serving as a nurse since its inception in 1999, she observed that males tend to shy away from the profession as the field is visibly female-dominant.</p>
<blockquote><p>“At Sunway Medical Centre, our male nurses are important team members who have contributed much to our success. Both our male and female nurses play to their strengths and advantage, thus they can equally contribute to our operational needs,” she said.</p></blockquote>

<h5>Sunway has intensified its support towards helping the nation achieve 80% herd immunity by providing Sunway Pyramid Convention Centre (SPCC) in Selangor rent-free for public vaccination.</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>As part of the National COVID-19 Immunisation Programme (NCIP), the vaccinations are scheduled to roll out in the next ten months till February 2022.</h5>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The vaccination rollout has been a turning point and a glimpse of hope for our nation, especially with MCO 3.0 being implemented nationwide due to the hike in COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>Sunway acknowledges the importance of responding swiftly to the crisis and has stepped up to launch the public vaccination at Sunway Pyramid Convention Centre (SPCC), which will be carried out progressively until February 2022.</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UvA_0-HEgSY" width="100%" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>The launch of the public vaccination was witnessed by state health director of Selangor, Dato’ Indera Dr. Sha’ari Bin Ngadiman, district officer of Petaling Land and District Office and director of Petaling District Disaster Management Committee Dato’ Johary bin Anuar alongside Sunway Group founder and chairman Tan Sri Dr. Jeffrey Cheah.</p>
<h2>Present from Day One</h2>
<p>Since COVID-19 hit the shores of Malaysia in March 2020, Sunway has committed more than RM50 million through various measures to help the nation fight the pandemic, including turning SPCC into Malaysia&#8217;s first large-scale vaccination centre.</p>
<p>State health director of Selangor, Dato’ Indera Dr. Sha’ari shared that with SPCC opening its doors for phase two of public vaccination, the vaccination process will be accelerated as resources and workforce are being mobilised towards a single location.</p>
<p>About 5,000 individuals are expected to be vaccinated per day at SPCC, which will be crucial to battle the pandemic as cases remain high in the country as of this writing.</p>

<h2>Purpose into Strategy</h2>
<p>However, Sunway is not stopping at just committing a rent-free space but has gone further to contribute multiple vaccination incentives provided by Sunway’s business divisions and the retailers of Sunway Pyramid.</p>
<p>Some of these incentives include free parking, vouchers and freebies for those who will be vaccinated in the coming months.</p>
<p>As the first private large-scale vaccination centre in the Petaling district, the 150,000 sq. ft. SPCC expects at least 1.8 million people in the Petaling district to walk through its doors to be vaccinated, with proper SOPs and social distancing in place for the health and safety of all involved.</p>
<p>District officer at Petaling Land and District Office, and director of Petaling District Disaster Management Committee, Dato’ Johary bin Anuar also pointed out that the strategic location of SPCC as a vaccination centre is a plus point for the convenience of the public.</p>
<p><em>“The speed in getting more vaccinations done is more imminent than ever. We need more corporations like Sunway Group, who quickly summed up the situation and provided the SPCC rent-free to support the government’s aim to achieve 80% herd immunity. Its strategic location that links public transportation and as well as free ample parking makes it convenient for the public,” said Dato’ Johary bin Anuar.</em></p>

<p>Sunway Group founder and chairman Tan Sri Dr. Jeffrey Cheah shared that Sunway will not shrink back in the face of adversity but will continue playing its part to the best of its ability in supporting the government’s initiatives towards accelerating the nation’s recovery.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“It is my personal belief that no corporation can live apart from the community it serves. As such, we strongly believe in doing well by doing good. In line with these values, we have committed more than RM50 million since the lockdown was imposed. You have my pledge that we will continue to help the communities we serve and stand by them in their hour of need,” declared Tan Sri Dr. Jeffrey Cheah.</em></p></blockquote>

<h5>Sunway Group expresses gratitude and appreciation to our frontline essential workers for their selfless efforts in ensuring the health and safety of all Malaysians this festive season.</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>As part of the ongoing #SunwayforGood initiative, Sunway is providing aid to various underserved communities nationwide to ensure no one is left behind in the spirit of togetherness and belonging this Raya.</h5>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As we ring in the Raya festivity amidst a changing landscape, the one thing that remains constant is the relentless hard work and sacrifices by our frontline superheroes to keep our nation safe and protected.</p>
<p>These heroes have been working tirelessly to provide the care and help that we need. This year, Sunway dedicates its festive video titled ‘Misi Seiring Bersama’ to all of them as a gesture of appreciation for their resilience, compassion and selfless efforts.</p>
<p>Inspired by the unwavering commitment of these frontline workers even during the festive period, the video follows Suraya, a nurse carrying out her duties during the month of Ramadhan. Set against the backdrop of the ongoing National COVID-19 Immunisation Programme (NCIP) being carried out at the Sunway Pyramid Convention Centre (SPCC), Suraya is determined to serve and care for others especially in these trying times.</p>
<p>With International Nurses Day coinciding with the eve of Hari Raya Aidilfitri on 12 May, the video also serves as a reminder of the importance of nurses in the healthcare system and the central role they play in amid the pandemic.</p>
<p>Since March 2020, Sunway has committed more than RM50 million to help our nation battle the COVID-19 pandemic, including offering SPCC and Sunway Medical Centre in Sunway City Kuala Lumpur rent-free as COVID-19 vaccination centres in support of the NCIP to achieve 80% herd immunity in the country.</p>
<p>‘Misi Seiring Bersama’ can be viewed on Sunway Group’s official <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SunwayGroupOfficial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sunwaygroupofficial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/2866490/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm79RrCIOJ50ZeFAJBeEhFA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> pages.</p>
<h2>Giving to Those Who Need it Most</h2>
<p>Aligned with Sunway’s commitment to continuously reach out to the B40 communities nationwide, we are partnering with various organisations to bring cheer to some 30,000 beneficiaries across Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Perak, Penang, Johor and Kelantan.</p>
<p>Our partnerships with various NGOs include Yayasan Kebajikan Negara Malaysia (YKN), Malaysian Red Crescent (MRC) and Selangor Association of Youth (SAY).</p>

<blockquote><p>“This coming Raya, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, sees the vulnerable communities disproportionately impacted – especially among the B40 communities.

&#8211; Sunway Group Brand Marketing and Communications Senior General Manager, Ms. Nik Tasha Nik Kamaruddin</p></blockquote>
<p>The Raja Muda’s visit is one of a wide range of efforts under the #SunwayforGood Raya Cheer initiatives nationwide. In Selangor, 185 orphans and underserved children from four homes namely Persatuan Kebajikan dan Perlindungan Rumah Jalinan Kasih, Pusat Jagaan Darul Sakinah Angkasa and Shelter Home for Children benefitted from this CSR effort.</p>

<h5>The primary aim is to bolster treatment of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and support patient experience by strengthening the primary care of Malaysia’s healthcare system.</h5>

<p>Sunway is now another step closer to positioning Malaysia at the forefront of healthcare digitalisation.</p>
<p>Witnessed by the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation (MOSTI) and supported by Sunway University, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signing has formed a new partnership between Sunway iLabs and AstraZeneca, establishing the first Health Innovation Hub (HIH) in Malaysia.</p>

<p>The Hub will play a vital role to spur the country’s research and development activities to bolster Malaysia’s battle against NCDs through a more robust primary care system.</p>
<p>It is in our plan to expand the accessibility of healthcare services through channel diversification using digital innovation and partnerships, making this joint initiative one of the many for the conglomerate to leverage.</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fSenPVyniLI" width="100%" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h2>The burden of NCDs in Malaysia</h2>
<p>A morbidity survey in 2019 revealed that NCDs account for 71% of premature deaths in Malaysia, and the surge of patients with NCDs has presented a major challenge to the healthcare system.</p>
<p>This challenge is further brought to light amid the pandemic. With statistics showing COVID-19 patients with NCDs are at a higher risk to develop complications more severe than others, with over 85% of fatalities in Malaysia living with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.</p>
<p>Turning no blind eye to these alarming statistics, AstraZeneca Malaysia Country President, Dr Sanjeev Panchal believes that the solution to this lies in strengthening Malaysia’s primary care ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote><p>“With a robust ecosystem in place, we can address the prevalence of NCDs, better support patient experience, and enable digital health innovation. By infusing digital technology into healthcare, we are able to solve healthcare problems ‘beyond the pill’, providing digital solutions that are affordable, universal, high-quality, and patient-centric. This creates unique experiences for patients which ultimately delivers more powerful healthcare over longer term.” &#8211; Dr Sanjeev Panchal, country president of AstraZeneca Malaysia</p></blockquote>
<h2>Paving the way for solutions ‘beyond the pill’</h2>
<p>With this being said, the HIH seeks to empower and equip start-ups and innovators to deliver new, sustainable solutions to address these pain points using digital technologies.</p>

<p>Through its open-innovation approach, the selected local start-ups and entrepreneurs will have access across Sunway’s ecosystem of 13 business divisions, on top of using Sunway City Kuala Lumpur as a living laboratory to bring their innovations to life.</p>
<p>Furthermore, AstraZeneca will also grant them access to their A. Catalyst Network of global health innovation hubs which will connect them to the talent and expertise from the hubs worldwide.</p>
<blockquote><p>“AstraZeneca aims to create partnerships with local healthcare innovators and provide them with the platform and tools needed to build sustainable ecosystems and further drive digital health innovation. This is aligned with the government’s priorities to integrate new technologies into patient pathways to combat the impact of NCDs,” Dr Sanjeev added.</p></blockquote>

<h5> Sunway Innovation Labs (Sunway iLabs) recently completed its Digital Transformation Acceleration Programme in collaboration with the Japanese External Trade Organisation (JETRO) Kuala Lumpur.</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>The programme is part of Sunway’s effort to expand Malaysia-Japan cross border partnerships and develop solutions for the betterment of the environment and humankind.</h5>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As the saying goes: “If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together”. – and this is certainly how Sunway intends to move forward.</p>
<p>Believing in the importance of partnerships to go further, Sunway through its innovation arm, Sunway iLabs, recently wrapped up the second cohort of its digital accelerator programme, first kicked off in 2019.</p>
<p>The three-month accelerator programme was brought to a close as five Japanese start-ups pitched to more than 200 potential business partners comprising start-ups, SMEs, MNCs and government agencies beyond Sunway’s ecosystem at a virtual session themed ‘Innovation Discovery with Japan’ on 18 March.</p>
<div id="attachment_22518" style="width: 651px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-22518" class="wp-image-22518" src="https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-virtual-pitching-session-by-Sunway-iLabs-in-collaboration-with-JETRO-350x209.jpg" alt="The virtual pitching session by Sunway iLabs in collaboration with JETRO" width="641" height="383" srcset="https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-virtual-pitching-session-by-Sunway-iLabs-in-collaboration-with-JETRO-200x119.jpg 200w, https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-virtual-pitching-session-by-Sunway-iLabs-in-collaboration-with-JETRO-350x209.jpg 350w, https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-virtual-pitching-session-by-Sunway-iLabs-in-collaboration-with-JETRO-400x239.jpg 400w, https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-virtual-pitching-session-by-Sunway-iLabs-in-collaboration-with-JETRO-600x358.jpg 600w, https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-virtual-pitching-session-by-Sunway-iLabs-in-collaboration-with-JETRO-768x458.jpg 768w, https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-virtual-pitching-session-by-Sunway-iLabs-in-collaboration-with-JETRO-800x477.jpg 800w, https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-virtual-pitching-session-by-Sunway-iLabs-in-collaboration-with-JETRO-1053x628.jpg 1053w, https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-virtual-pitching-session-by-Sunway-iLabs-in-collaboration-with-JETRO.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px" /><p id="caption-attachment-22518" class="wp-caption-text">The “Innovation Discovery with Japan” virtual pitching session by Sunway iLabs in collaboration with JETRO Kuala Lumpur on 18 March</p></div>
<p>Leading up to the final pitch, Sunway iLabs mentored five companies – Funlead, Synspective, Aerosense, Toyeight and Studist – based on their product verticals and organised business matchings with relevant local partners for commercialisation, corporate feedback, pilot testing as well as research and development.</p>
<p>Throughout the entire programme, the companies focused on five verticals of agritech, proptech, smart cities, edutech and software as a service (SAAS) and were given access to resources across our 13 business divisions and Sunway City Kuala Lumpur&#8217;s (SCKL) ecosystem for potential partnerships, talent recruitment and market intelligence research.</p>
<p>Aiming to discover the potential of each company and how their expertise can be further developed in Malaysia are aligned with our ultimate goal to position SCKL as a living laboratory, bringing in experts to generate sustainable, real-world solutions for future urban spaces towards the betterment of the environment and humankind.</p>
<p>Sunway Group Chief Innovation Officer and Sunway iLabs Director Matt van Leeuwen is a strong believer in fostering the right environment for the growth of entrepreneurship in Malaysia.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We first developed the Sunway iLabs – JETRO Kuala Lumpur accelerator programme in 2019 to help fast track the growth of Japanese companies into the Southeast Asian market, using Sunway’s ecosystem in Malaysia as a launchpad for success. We provide consultation and market access by facilitating discussions between Sunway business units and the Japanese start-ups, as well as connect them with industry partners, researchers, and even venture capitalists. With the completion of the Digital Transformation Acceleration Programme and the business matching exercise, we hope to see further collaborations between these high-potential start-ups and the correct partners within our ecosystem to develop successfully together.” – Matt van Leeuwen</p></blockquote>
<p>JETRO Kuala Lumpur Managing Director Mai Onozawa echoes his sentiments, reiterating the benefits the programme has brought the five start-ups who have considered Malaysia as a launchpad to the rest of the region.</p>
<blockquote><p>“In recent years, JETRO has been focusing on supporting collaborations among talented start-ups and big companies of Malaysia and Japan through digital technology. In collaboration with Sunway who has opened its networks and resources, we have been able to intensify the support for Japanese companies finding their partners and expanding their businesses in Malaysia.” – Mai Onozawa</p></blockquote>

<p>Smart Drive and Allm Group are the two start-ups of the first cohort of the Sunway iLabs-JETRO Kuala Lumpur accelerator programme. Establishing an office in Sunway FutureX, both companies have since begun performing pilot projects with the support of different Sunway business divisions.</p>
<p>SmartDrive is currently working on reducing traffic accidents and improving road safety in Malaysia and Southeast Asia through its cloud service that produces visualisation of driving data and safe driving support. On the other hand, Allm Group is currently working with Sunway Medical Centre to advance emergency medical management in Malaysia, assisting hospital communications between doctors and patients for health progress, appointments and delivery of drugs.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Sunway iLabs intends to continue providing tech start-ups with an avenue to expand their businesses that will lead to the adoption of more sustainable practices. Sunway will continue to find opportunities to forge more partnerships and collaborations to move one step closer towards becoming a living lab and a model sustainable city in Malaysia now and in the years to come.</p>

<h5>The award is a prestigious recognition for the social impact the Group’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts has brought to the local community.</h5>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Built on the foundation of service above self and reaching out to the underserved communities, we actively work towards enhancing the lives of others through our three key pillars of education, healthcare and community enrichment through our various CSR initiatives.</p>
<p>At the 75th anniversary celebration, our collective efforts were acknowledged by the Department of Social Welfare Malaysia, where we were prestigiously awarded in recognition of the impact our CSR efforts had brought upon the community.</p>

<p>Sunway Group founder and chairman Tan Sri Dr. Jeffrey Cheah received the award from Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin at the ceremony held in Putrajaya International Convention Centre.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are humbled by the recognition. This award goes to our family at Sunway who work tirelessly to not only innovate for long-term solutions to the world’s most pressing challenges, but also to reach out to those who need it the most at every step of the way, so that no one will be left behind on the path to progress. The goals of the UN-SDGs are not the work of governments alone – it is everyone’s responsibility. We are all in this together.” ~ said Tan Sri Dr. Jeffrey Cheah</p></blockquote>
<h2>Continuing the good work</h2>
<p>To date, our #SunwayforGood initiatives has impacted over half a million Malaysians across the country, with a greater goal to double the number and touch one million lives by 2030.</p>

<p>All of our initiatives are underscored by our commitment to advancing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs).</p>
<p>Leading up to Sunway’s 50th anniversary in 2024, we have also set out to fulfil four pledges starting this year, which include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Build and refurbish</strong> at least <strong>50 libraries</strong> through the <strong>Sunway READ programme</strong></li>
<li>Pack <strong>one million meals</strong> to undernourished communities</li>
<li>Set up <strong>50 urban farms for 50 orphanages</strong></li>
<li>Provide <strong>basic health screening</strong> in partnership with the National Kidney Foundation for <strong>50 Orang Asal communities</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Since the onset of the pandemic in 2020, Sunway Group has committed more than RM50 million in aid, which includes more than RM12 million to support government healthcare institutions and professionals, RM20 million to provide retailers rent-free days during the first MCO, and more than RM28 million to support the current National COVID-19 Immunisation Programme (NCIP).</p>

<p>To further support the ongoing NCIP, we also recently committed Sunway Pyramid Convention as the first private large-scale vaccination centre for the Petaling district, rent-free. The 150,000 sq. ft. convention centre opened its doors on 10 March and will oversee the vaccinations for over 1.8 million people until February 2022.</p>
<p>Up north, we have also sponsored RM1 million to set up the #SunwayforGood Anjung Kasih Yayasan Kebajikan Negara for Hospital Seberang Jaya in Penang. The sponsorship went towards providing temporary accommodation for family members of the underserved community that are accompanying their loved ones receiving treatment at government hospitals.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Sunway is embarking on its Hari Raya CSR campaign for the upcoming festive season, which aims to reach out to a total of 20,000 beneficiaries nationwide.</p>
<p>All of these commitments were carried out to help Malaysians flatten the curve and alleviate the hardships of those most impacted by the pandemic such as frontline workers, small businesses as well as families and individuals from the B40 communities.</p>

These graduands comprise  working adults from both private and public sectors who wish to acquire expertise in designing and implementing sustainable development practices.</p>
<p>MSDM is the first postgraduate degree in Sustainable Development Management offered in Malaysia run by the Jeffrey Sachs Center on Sustainable Development based in Sunway University. It is delivered through an 18-month program comprising classroom sessions, virtual tutorials, e-modules, research projects; and individual and group assignments; and a 12-month program that is fully online with virtual lectures and tutorials, e-modules and online assignments and research projects.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Sachs, Chairman of the Center and Distinguished Professor at Sunway University, expressed his pride in Sunway University in graduating its first MSDM cohort,</p>
<p>“In the short time since its launch, the programme, the first of its kind in Malaysia, has gained international attention that subsequently led to its expansion to a fully online programme that can attract students from all across the world. This to me is a testament to the tenacity of Tan Sri Dr. Jeffrey Cheah and his determination to build human capacities that tackle societal and environmental challenges in Malaysia, Asia and the world. I see this programme growing from strength to strength. My congratulations to its first graduating class of changemakers,” expressed Jeffrey Sachs.</p>

<p>Tan Sri Dr. Jeffrey Cheah, founder and chancellor of Sunway University, also gave praise to the graduate’s achievements, citing them as future nation builders to create a brighter, more sustainable future for all.</p>
<blockquote><p>“My heartiest congratulations to the first cohort of Master in Sustainable Development Management. I believe with this new generation of leaders equipped with the knowledge, science and analytical as well as critical thinking skills, we can make real, positive and lasting changes for our nation, our region and our world,” expressed Tan Sri Dr. Jeffrey Cheah</p></blockquote>
<p>Tan Sri Dr. Jeffrey Cheah also expressed his gratitude for the wholehearted dedication and commitment of the educators in Jeffrey Sachs Center whose efforts were instrumental in reaching this milestone.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Advancing the sustainability agenda is not the responsibility of Governments alone. Building a sustainable future requires the commitment of all elements of society &#8211; the private sector, academia, civil society, and, of course, every single individual,” he explained further.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Adapting to the New Normal</h2>
<p>The pandemic has forced a transformation in education and its delivery, with SOPs and movement control orders proving to be an obstacle for on-campus studies and face-to-face learning.</p>
<p>Thus, the MSDM programme expanded to include a full online delivery mode in October 2020, parallel to the existing blended mode of in-class-cum-online delivery, in order to accommodate students with difficulties coming to campus.</p>
<p>Professor Woo Wing Thye, Director of the Jeffrey Sachs Center, said that the COVID-19 Pandemic that appeared in full force in late March necessitated instructors to switch the delivery mode of their teaching from in-class delivery to online delivery.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Thanks to the hard work and incredibly ingenuous innovations of the instructors, the move to online teaching and online discussion was accomplished successfully and quickly. Academic quality was maintained and physical safety were assured for the MSDM class. I am most proud that the unavoidable campus lockdown has not delayed adversely the completion of study by the first cohort, nor did it diminish the professional and personal interaction among the students and between the faculty and the students. Moreover, this successful adjustment to adversity has motivated the MSDM program to create a second track of the program to reach students who are outside Malaysia through a fully online track. My congratulations to the graduating students who studied hard together under adversity,” exclaimed Professor Woo Wing Thye.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Program Leader, Professor Leong Choon Heng, believes the programme is in line with Sunway University’s mission to promote sustainable development through education, research and professional training.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The journey began in January 2019 with the hope that through learning together, students, faculty and staff will develop ideas and practical solutions to help achieve the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and promote a manner of development that is good for humanity, the environment and our planet. Each graduate, in his or her own way, has gone on to lead organisations in the direction of sustainability. Each will be an inspiration for many more cohorts of students to come. Indeed, it has been deeply gratifying to have worked and learned together with so many in this cohort,” he said.</p></blockquote>
<h2>From the Heart of the Students</h2>
<p>We have also caught up with the students on how their odyssey in the MSDM programme has transformed their mindset for a better future.</p>

<p>One of the graduating students is Steven Sim, Member of Parliament for Bukit Mertajam and former Malaysian Deputy Minister for Youth and Sports.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The programme gave me the privilege to learn from world class thinkers, and experienced practitioners in the various fields of sustainable development. As a legislator and policymaker, I find myself better equipped with up-to-date knowledge, skills and tools to deal with my work,” said Steven.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another graduate, Tahirah Banu Mohd Ariff, who works with WWF Malaysia’s Plastics Initiative, shares how her time at the programme has given her an outlook of what she can bring to the table.</p>

<blockquote><p>“We were exposed to the economic and business considerations to sustainable development in relevance to climate change, urban sustainability, energy, water, infrastructure, biodiversity, land-use, waste management, and business responsibility. As my work involves working with businesses, I am able to apply this knowledge and bring valuable technical insights on addressing sustainability challenges faced by the private sector,” she said.</p></blockquote>

<p>And last but not least, Selvaraj Supramaniam, who works as director of RAPS Solutions, a renewable energy provider, has his say on the programme and the key takeaways from it.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Through the programme I now have in-depth understanding of the importance of balancing economic, environmental and social factors in equal harmony for sustainable development. Covering multiple disciplines, the programme was well structured to deliver practical strategies required in my field of renewable energy. A team of dedicated and experienced experts also made the programme very interesting,” said Selvaraj.</p></blockquote>
<p>We at Sunway express our heartiest congratulations to the inaugural cohort of Master of Sustainable Development Management programme. We also wish the programme all the success in producing more inspiring graduates working towards meeting the goals of sustainable development.</p>

<h5>Moving away from home for the first time can be a daunting experience for some young adults.</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>The new environment, people and weather can be a little overwhelming – a stark difference to the comfort and convenience of your own home.</h5>
</li>

<h5>Therefore, it is essential to find the right accommodation to not only help ease your transition to university, but also offer a little comfort away from home.</h5>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a compilation of student accommodations that you can choose from to ensure your university experience puts your mind at ease before you head off to Manchester, Bristol or Sheffield for your dream school.</p>

<p>Ask any student about Fallowfield, Manchester and you’ll probably hear about how lively this town centre is, with tantalising restaurants and green parks!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It sounds like a stunning location, and <a href="https://www.mansionstudent.co.uk/student-accommodation/manchester/mcr-mansion-point/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mansion Point </a>sits right at the core of that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Created with the desires of a modern student in mind, Mansion Point offers a range of living options – from an ensuite to create memories in a shared space with your fellow mates, to the solace of privacy of a studio or a one-bed apartment.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to being a humble abode, Mansion Point also provides a great opportunity to forge strong bonds, and its spacious communal area offers a range of activities to do just that – a pool table to show off your trick shots, a cosy movie room to chill and unwind, or a study nook to enjoy a good book. All in all, you will be creating memories for life.</p>

<p>Manchester is commonly known as England’s second city.

<p>Located in the heart of Bristol, the red-brick Centre Gate appears as a typical student housing from the outside.

<p>The student housing complements the bustling city life of Bristol, a vibrant and dynamic metropolitan steeped in arts and culture as evident from the expressive street art at Upfest to the pottery and life drawing offered at Bristol Folk House. It may not come as a surprise that Bristol was voted the best city in Britain in a major survey of 20,000 university students across the country.</p>

<p>Two minutes away in a modest, traditional looking building is The Colston Bristol student accommodation. Equipped with mix studios and two bedroom apartments, it was named after Edward Colston, a Bristol-born English merchant, philanthropist, slave trader, and Member of Parliament.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Colston boasts a fantastic city centre location – it’s only a short walk from College Green and Park Street. The University of Bristol is less than 10 minutes away by foot, and you can get to University of the West of England in no time with a bus stop directly outside!</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Colston offers rooms that cater to both extroverts and introverts. For those who crave for solitude, the independent living spaces are perfect choices for them. The two bed apartment, on the other hand, caters for social creatures who seek interactions.</p>

<p>Be a part of the ultimate student living experience with The Colston’s high quality, modern features fitted throughout all rooms.

<h2>Accommodating to the Post-Pandemic Structure</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With vaccinations the new talk of the town, the notion of on-campus studying is on the cards in the near future. With that, accommodations (both literally and figuratively) must be made for this transition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote>
<p>“Pre-pandemic, student occupancy rates were typically above 97%. Not only do we anticipate a bounce back in the near future, but the number of full-time students in the UK has reached a record level, and is only set to grow. This fund provides investors with the opportunity to capitalise on the compelling UK student market with an established and trusted partner,” said Mohammed Iqbal, CEO of MBU Capital.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Underpinned by positive demand for undergraduate places and an acute undersupply of student accommodation exacerbated by construction delays, <a href="https://sunwayrecapital.com/">Sunway RE Capital</a> has forged a transcontinental partnership with MBU Capital to invest and manage Purpose Built Student Accommodation (PBSA) assets in the UK, following signs of recovery in the sector. The collaboration has been pre-seeded through a combination of assets and readily deployable equity, totalling £110m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote>
<p>“We believe the UK is most likely to remain one of the world&#8217;s most popular student hotspots and demand from overseas for high-quality education is expected to rise once travel restrictions have been lifted. We’re optimistic about this sector and we’ve created a fund management team which has a track record of sourcing and delivering world class institutional stock,” said Dr Tan Kok Heng, Executive Director at Sunway RE Capital, part of the Sunway Group.</p>

<h5>The distinguished Professor Sibrandes Poppema, who hails from the Netherlands, was recently handed the reigns of Sunway University as its newest president.</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>With decades of experience and academic excellence, he is now looking forward to steering Sunway University to even greater heights.    </h5>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Mention the name Professor Sibrandes Poppema to any academician and you will probably receive an affirmative nod or words of acknowledgement for his many achievements over the years as an education trailblazer and medical researcher.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With years of leadership experience in medical academics, Professor Sibrandes was trained as a pathologist and holds a doctorate in Immunopathology from the University of Groningen, and also holds postdoc positions at the University of Kiel in Germany and Harvard University in the USA.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --><!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Besides being in the top 2% of highly cited authors across the world in the field of immunology, Professor Sibrandes recently retired as president of the University of Groningen, where he was instrumental in establishing the University Campus Fryslan and European Medical School Oldenburg Groningen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As newly appointed president of Sunway University, Professor Sibrandes is just getting started.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>On his appointment: a part of the Sunway family</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Professor Sibrandes’ acquaintance with the faculty began in 2017 when he was invited to speak at the Jeffrey Cheah Distinguished Speaker Series on ‘Building a Leading University: From Regional Roots to Global Significance’ – which, in hindsight, may have been a foreshadowing of when he would one day take on this leadership position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<div id="attachment_12299" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12299" class="wp-image-12299" src="https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/prof-Proppema-jeffrey-cheah-1024x536-1.jpg" alt="Professor Sibrandes: Man on a Mission" width="1024" height="536" data-id="12299" data-full-url="https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/prof-Proppema-jeffrey-cheah.jpg" data-link="https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/?attachment_id=12299" /><p id="caption-attachment-12299" class="wp-caption-text">Professor Sibrandes was recently bestowed The Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany for his work in promoting internationalisation.</p></div>
<div id="attachment_12298" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12298" class="wp-image-12298" src="https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Officer-Cross-of-Order-of-Merit-1024x536-1.jpg" alt="Professor Sibrandes: Man on a Mission" width="1024" height="536" data-id="12298" data-full-url="https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Officer-Cross-of-Order-of-Merit.jpg" data-link="https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/?attachment_id=12298" /><p id="caption-attachment-12298" class="wp-caption-text">The Officer&#8217;s Cross of the Order of Merit is rarely awarded &#8211; in this case was to acknowledge Professor Sibrandes&#8217; contributions to improving relations with his home country and Germany.</p></div>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two years later, he was then appointed as a Tan Sri Jeffrey Cheah Distinguished Professor and Advisor to the Chancellor on the establishment of a medical school at Sunway University. This provided him the time to adapt, as he sees life as a continuous opportunity to learn and gain experiences, especially from those of different cultures.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“The major difference between my previous universities and Sunway University is that Sunway University is still young and therefore much more agile. When we want to do something new, we just do it. Also, Malaysia, and Asia in general are growing faster than European and North American countries with much more of a can-do attitude.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“I am optimistic about the opportunities this new normal will offer to Malaysia and our ecosystem here at Sunway. What we have learned as a university is that electronic learning methods are of much more value than previously thought, but also that young students crave for the company and learning environment that only campus universities can provide. After all, they are not just learning but also growing up during their university period and that is tough behind a computer screen,” Said Professor Sibrandes.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>On Sustainability: Caring for Life and the Planet</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With sustainability a bedrock of Sunway as a whole, Professor Sibrandes views it as a great opportunity to go beyond and embrace Planetary Health, especially with the newfound establishment of a medical school at Sunway University.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote>
<p>“Planetary Health is a step beyond Global Health because it also takes into account  our environment, the planet earth, needs to be healthy as well – all Sustainable Development Goals are a part of that,” explained Professor Sibrandes.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To him, it is the perfect opportunity to promote further interdisciplinary research between the Schools, Centre and Departments, as well as working with other academic institutions, industries, government and the general population – all of which are part of Sunway’s ambitions in creating a sustainable, liveable smart city with education at the centre of it all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote>
<p>“Together with the new Pro Vice Chancellor of Research, Engagement and Impact, Professor Mahendhiran Nair, we will work hard to achieve this goal. Working with all the companies in Sunway provides us with a unique opportunity not many other universities can emulate. And then we have the extraordinary successes of Sunway iLabs under the direction of Matt van Leeuwen,” he added.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->
<div id="attachment_12300" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12300" class="wp-image-12300" src="https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/prof-sibrandes-with-the-cross-1024x536-1.jpg" alt="Professor Sibrandes: Man on a Mission" width="1024" height="536" /><p id="caption-attachment-12300" class="wp-caption-text">A sustainable foundation will lead to a sustainable future, and that is something Professor Sibrandes hopes to achieve through collaborations and consistent hard work.</p></div>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He further lauds Tan Sri Dr. Jeffrey Cheah for being a trailblazer in sustainability and education in Sunway, which led to the establishment of the Jeffrey Sachs Center and SDG Academy, which are now both fully integrated in Sunway University.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>On the Sunway Medical School: Expansion and Growth  </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Professor Sibrandes first settled down in Sunway a couple of years ago to lay the groundwork for the medical school, he was faced with a unique challenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --><!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Malaysia had a moratorium on medical schools and therefore required Sunway to present a convincing case as to why there should be one within the university. Sunway then joined hands with its partners at the University of Cambridge and Sunway Medical Centre for the proposal, leading to Sunway being granted an exemption in 2020.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote>
<p>“Starting a medical school is a big challenge and even greater opportunity. My previous experience in helping the University of Oldenburg in starting a new medical school with a modern problem-based, competency-oriented curriculum was an uphill battle as well. Existing medical schools in Germany and medical societies actively campaigned against it and the Federal Ministry of Health initially was not in favour, but eventually we managed to get approval with the strong support of the Scientific Council of Germany, based on the role that the University of Groningen would play in support,” explained Professor Sibrandes.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He then goes on to reveal that the first batch of students have completed their studies, with the medical school revered as exemplary in Germany – leading him to receive the Officer’s Cross in the Order of Merit from  the Federal Republic of Germany.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote>
<p>“For the Sunway University Medical School, we have the support of the University of Cambridge that will help us raise the level of research-based education. The key ingredients are persistence and high quality,” he added.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>On Students and Staff: Creating the Best Environment for the New Normal</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Professor Sibrandes, perspective is the most important thing to provide students and staff in weathering these unprecedented times. Through these tumultuous times, he assures that all students can make good progress in their studies through the university’s offerings, whether fully online or through face-to-face interactions where allowed by the government.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote>
<p>“We are aiming to return to a full campus experience as soon as possible because we are a campus university, and our students take pride in constituting ‘The Most Happening Campus’. In the meantime, Sunway Education Group provides psychological and other support to students and staff that may need it. For instance, students who don’t have proper internet connections to study from home can come to campus to do so,” he explained.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->
<div id="attachment_12301" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12301" class="wp-image-12301" src="https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/professor-sibrandes-1024x536-1.jpg" alt="Professor Sibrandes: Man on a Mission" width="1024" height="536" /><p id="caption-attachment-12301" class="wp-caption-text">While Sunway University has amalgamated digital tools and practical classes, Professor Sibrandes looks forward to welcoming all students back to &#8220;The Most Happening Campus&#8221; soon.</p></div>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to student satisfaction, Professor Sibrandes believes that he has a sturdy foundation to build on, as Sunway University has produced exemplary students over the years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --><!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Through the right combination of digital tools and practical experiences, he opines that the university is on the right track, and that they are also working on coordinating programmes for students to spend some time at top universities globally to enrich their learning experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>On the Success of Sunway University: Continuous Improvement for the Future</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Besides focusing on the expansion of the Medical School, Professor Sibrandes notes that the university is also working to ensure other students receive a unique, enriching experience in Sunway.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bayrocks Lakeside will house the School of Business and School of Arts. In the new building, the School of Arts will have the opportunity to carry out more public outreach through concerts and exhibitions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In his opinion, Sunway University has made incredible progress in its first ten years, making it into the global top 2% for universities. To him, for the university to place in the top 1%, it needs to progress to place around 350 in the next few years, something that he feels is not out of reach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the quality and quantity of scientific papers published in Sunway increasing, and the output of Sunway University now only behind the top five research universities in Malaysia, Professor Sibrandes is optimistic that it is only a matter of time before Sunway University will reach the peak.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote>
<p>“But it is not just a matter of time, we also need to further enhance our brand as a modern, sustainable, research intensive and superb teaching university. Do well and talk about it,” concluded Professor Sibrandes.</p>

<h5>This is part of Sunway’s commitment to support the National Immunisation Plan in Malaysia.</h5>

<p>For Malaysians and billions of people around the globe, the advent of the COVID-19 vaccines has become a sigh of relief as they look towards enjoying some semblance of normalcy in their lives.</p>

<p>Sunway is honoured to be a part of the National COVID-19 Immunisation Programme and looks forward to providing aid where it is needed most.</p>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After months of planning, Sunway Pyramid Convention Centre (SPCC) opened its doors free of charge to carry out vaccinations for up to 1.8 million people in the Petaling district from now until February 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<div id="attachment_12279" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12279" class="wp-image-12279" src="https://www.sunway.com.my/stories/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/doctor-holding-the-syringe-and-the-vaccine-1024x536-1.jpg" alt="Injecting Hope – Sunway Steps Up to Keep the Nation Safe" width="1024" height="536" /><p id="caption-attachment-12279" class="wp-caption-text">Up to 1.8 million frontline workers and residents in the Petaling district will be vaccinated safely in the Centre</p></div>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In line with the National Immunisation Plan, SPCC will be the venue for carrying out vaccinations for healthcare workers in government and private facilities and essential services until April 2021. This will be followed by the remaining healthcare workers, essential workers, enforcers as well as senior citizens and high-risk groups from April to August 2021, and vaccinations for the rest of the community from August 2021 to February next year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph --><!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As of mid-March, more than 2,500 frontline workers have been vaccinated. The vaccination is carried out by the Petaling Health District Office with strict adherence to the SOPs, in small groups, with adequate social distancing.

<blockquote>
<p>“Sunway is committed to nation building by offering our Convention Centre in support of the 80% herd immunity in Malaysia, which will save lives and livelihoods and put us back as a nation on the road to building back economic sustainability,” said Tan Sri Datuk Seri Razman M. Hashim.</p>

<p>In response, the Petaling District Disaster Management Committee also lauded the initiative by Sunway to avail the centre for a good cause.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote>
<p>“Sunway Pyramid Convention Centre has the ideal size, strategic location, and infrastructure support we need to ensure the smooth roll-out of the vaccinations. We are thankful to Sunway Group for its prompt response in offering its convention centre as a vaccination hub and supporting the national immunisation programme,” a statement from the Petaling District Disaster Management.</p>

<p>Aside from providing the centre for vaccinations, Sunway has also embarked on other immunisation measures, beginning in our own backyard. In the beginning of March, our very own medical heroes from both Sunway Medical Centre (SMC) and Sunway Medical Centre Velocity (SMCV) received their first doses of the vaccine.</p>
